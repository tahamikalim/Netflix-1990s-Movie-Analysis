Netflix 1990s Movie Analysis

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about movies from the 1990s. The goal is to gain insights into various aspects of these movies, such as their duration and genre characteristics.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

In this analysis, we explore the netflix_data.csv dataset to answer specific questions about 1990s movies, particularly focusing on the following:

Frequent Movie Duration: Identify the most common movie duration during the 1990s. The result is stored as an integer value named duration.

Short Action Movies Count: A movie is classified as "short" if its duration is less than 90 minutes. We count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s, storing this value as an integer named short_movie_count.


SKILLS AND TOOLS DEMONSTRATED:

This project highlights my skills in:

Data Wrangling: Handling and cleaning data to make it suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns and insights within the dataset.

Python Programming: Utilizing Python for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: Leveraging the Pandas library for data processing.

Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to derive meaningful insights from the data.

HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY:

Dataset: The dataset used in this analysis, netflix_data.csv, should be placed in the root directory of this repository.

Scripts: The analysis is performed in the provided Jupyter Notebook file, which walks through each step of the EDA.

Results: The final output includes the identified movie duration (duration) and the count of short action movies (short_movie_count).


CONCLUSION:

This project is a demonstration of my ability to perform detailed exploratory data analysis on real-world datasets, providing actionable insights and valuable experience in Data Science.
